# vt2-stats-analyzer
A data-based and data-inspired approach to visualizing game stats of players in Vermintide 2.

To run the app, clone the repo and then run in your npm console:

```
npm install
node server.js
```

Will add more to this later...

Filenames should be as:

```
<Full-Map-Name>_<Difficulty>_<Win>
```

Example for Athel Yenlui on Champion, where the team won:

```
Athel-Yenlui_Champion_1
```
